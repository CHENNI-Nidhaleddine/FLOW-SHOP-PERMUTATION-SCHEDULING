## Flow shop permutation
The flow shop permutation problem is a classic scheduling problem that aims to find the optimal sequence of tasks for a set of jobs in a flow shop environment. The objective is to minimize the total processing time of all jobs.

## Branch and bound
The branch and bound algorithm is an exact algorithm that systematically explores the solution space to find the optimal solution. It starts with an initial solution and divides the problem into subproblems to find the best possible solution.

## Heuristics
Heuristic algorithms are designed to quickly find a good solution without exhaustively searching all possible solutions. This section implements various heuristic algorithms for the flow shop permutation problem, such as the NEH heuristic, the CDS heuristic, and the SPT heuristic.

## Meta Heuristics
Metaheuristic algorithms are designed to explore the search space more efficiently than heuristics by using probabilistic techniques. This section implements various metaheuristic algorithms for the flow shop permutation problem, such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and tabu search.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this repository contains an implementation of branch and bound, heuristics, and metaheuristics for the flow shop permutation problem. The implemented algorithms aim to find the optimal sequence of tasks that minimize the total processing time for a set of jobs in a flow shop environment. The Taillard instances provided in the repository can be used to test the performance of the algorithms.
