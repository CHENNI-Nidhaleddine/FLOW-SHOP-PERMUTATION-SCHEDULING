# FLOW-SHOP-PERMUTATION-SCHEDULING
<p>This repository provides an implementation of branch and bound, heuristics, and metaheuristics for the flow shop permutation problem. The implemented algorithms aim to find an optimal sequence of tasks to minimize the total processing time for a set of jobs in a flow shop environment.</p>
